## Disclosure Policy

This project follows responsible disclosure:

- Please allow reasonable time to investigate and patch before public disclosure.
- If the issue is confirmed, a fix will be developed and released as soon as practical.
- Once a fix is available, a public advisory/release notes entry may be published describing the issue and mitigation.

## Security Updates

Security fixes will be released as normal GitHub Releases and documented in release notes when possible.
